          Yatoha TechHub Solutions was born in 2020 from a passionate vision to
          bridge the gap between innovation and collaboration in the Nigerian
          tech ecosystem. Our founders recognized a critical need: while there
          was no shortage of talent and ideas in Nigeria, there was a disconnect
          between academic learning, practical skills, and industry needs. The
          concept of Yatoha emerged as a solution to this challenge. We
          envisioned a space where learners could gain hands-on experience,
          where industry experts could share their knowledge, and where
          innovative solutions could be developed to address real-world
          problems. From day one, the TechHub has been at the core of our
          organization. More than just an innovation center, it was designed as
          a mentorship hub – a place where experienced professionals could guide
          and nurture emerging talent. This mentor-mentee model quickly became
          our hallmark, setting us apart in the tech education and development
          landscape. In our early days, we focused on building a team of experts
          across various domains of tech solutions development. We brought
          together specialists in data science, software engineering, product
          management, graphic design, and more. This multidisciplinary approach
          allowed us to take on complex projects and deliver comprehensive
          solutions. As we grew, we expanded our training programs, always with
          an eye on practical, industry-relevant skills. We developed a
          project-based curriculum and implemented a one-student-to-tutor model
          to ensure personalized learning experiences.

            Recognizing the power of technology in education, we integrated
            virtual sessions to enhance our delivery and reach learners across
            geographical boundaries. Our commitment to bridging the gap between
            education and industry led us to incorporate mentorship programs,
            interview preparation, and networking opportunities into our
            offerings. We understood that technical skills alone were not enough
            – our learners needed guidance on how to navigate the professional
            world of tech. In parallel with our educational initiatives, we've
            continually expanded our solutions development capabilities.

            TechHub Solutions stands as a testament to our founding vision.
